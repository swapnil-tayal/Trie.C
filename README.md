# Trie Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Trie data structure in the C programming language. A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of a dynamic set of strings.


## Features

- Insertion of strings into the Trie
- Search for strings in the Trie
- Search for prefix of a strings in the Trie
- Memory-efficient storage of strings

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [A C compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - This project is written in C, so you need a C compiler to build and run the code.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapnil-tayal/Trie.c.git

### Usage
Directly import the trie.c file in your main file and use the respective functions to perform operations

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open a pull request if you find any issues or want to enhance the implementation.
